\# Enterprise Blue Team Defense



\## Overview

This repository represents a practical, enterprise-focused Blue Team knowledge base covering detection engineering, threat hunting, incident response, and digital forensics.



The goal of this project is to document defensive security methodologies and artifacts that align with real-world SOC and DFIR operations rather than tool-specific labs or purely theoretical exercises.

\## Core Focus Areas



\### 🔵 Detection Engineering

\- Detection lifecycle aligned with threat intelligence and MITRE ATT\&CK

\- Behavioral detections over static indicators

\- Sigma-based detection logic for cross-platform portability

\- Continuous tuning and detection maturity



\### 🔍 Threat Hunting

\- Hypothesis-driven threat hunting methodology

\- Identity, endpoint, and cloud-centric hunts

\- Translating hunt findings into actionable detections



\### 🚨 Incident Response

\- Enterprise-grade incident response playbooks

\- Focus on containment, eradication, and recovery

\- Post-incident feedback loops into detections and controls



\### 🧪 Purple Teaming

\- Detection validation through attack simulation

\- ATT\&CK coverage analysis

\- Continuous improvement of defensive posture

\## Design Principles

\- Focus on attacker behavior, not signatures

\- Assume compromise and validate detections

\- Prefer high-signal, low-noise detections

\- Treat detections as living artifacts



---



\## Intended Audience

\- Blue Team analysts

\- Detection engineers

\- SOC engineers

\- DFIR practitioners

\- Security leadership seeking operational insight
