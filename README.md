\# Enterprise Blue Team Defense 🛡️



This repository represents advanced defensive security work

focused on detection engineering, threat hunting, incident response,

and digital forensics within enterprise environments.



The content reflects real-world SOC operations, DFIR workflows,

and detection maturity practices aligned with modern threat landscapes.



\## Core Objectives

\- Engineer high-fidelity detections based on attacker behavior

\- Perform hypothesis-driven threat hunting

\- Develop repeatable incident response playbooks

\- Analyze adversary tradecraft through malware and forensic artifacts

\- Continuously validate detection coverage using MITRE ATT\&CK



\## Domains Covered

\- Detection Engineering \& Sigma

\- Threat Hunting \& Adversary Emulation

\- Incident Response \& Crisis Handling

\- Malware Analysis \& Reverse Engineering Support

\- Digital Forensics \& Timeline Reconstruction

\- Telemetry \& Logging Strategy

\- Purple Team Detection Validation



\## Defensive Philosophy

\- Behavior over signatures

\- Telemetry before tooling

\- Detection is code

\- Assume breach, validate controls



\## Disclaimer

This repository is strictly for defensive security research

and educational purposes. No offensive misuse is supported.
